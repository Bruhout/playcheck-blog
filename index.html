                        Hi ! We're PlayCheck, and this is our blog page. We talk about video games here. Only the 
                        most passionate might find their place on this blog page. There is no room for corporate 
                        slack, and no place for souless cash grabs. If you understand the rules, please proceed 
                        to our thoughts on everything that is gaming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will very soon be introducing a personal forum for all users to interact, along with 
                        comments under the blogs. Until then, please use the following reddit page for all your 
                        discussion needs.

            parkinsons by the end of a stage. Ultrakill is a game made out of glitches. This game promotes the
            player to break it in every way imaginable, and to beat each stage as the baddest gunslinger out there
            The suprisingly fleshed out storyline is the cherry on the top, because hell yeah, I'm the killer 
            robot who's gonna empty hell. Oh and the visuals are actually pretty sweet on the eyes. The best 
            indie game in quite a long time, we will be playing this for a while."

            Everything hollow knight can pull with such a simplistic combat system is incredible. The visual are
            mesmerising and all lore will have you sitting on wiki pages for hours. The map is incredibly huge
